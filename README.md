## Usage
You can easily use this app to monitor your IP Camera with ONVIF Compliancy.

## Compatibility
Compatible with any ONVIF Compliant IP Camera including the ones that I've tested personally below:
* Hikvision
* Dahua
* Reolink
* Uniwiz

## Additional Functionality
There are some code which I commented out, you can enable them by uncommenting AND adding the required ONVIF WSDL for that specific function.
